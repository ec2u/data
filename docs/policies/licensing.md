EC2U Knowledge Hub datasets MUST advertise copyright holders and licensing conditions using the
relevant [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) terms as detailed in
the [dataset catalog](../datasets/index.md) specs. Dataset licensing terms are expected to comply with the following
requirements:

* the [dct:license](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_license) property of the dataset MUST link the
  well-known public URL of a legal document detailing the licensing conditions
* dataset content SHOULD be licensed under the terms of a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) license
* dataset produced
  with [EC2U](https://education.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document-library-docs/european-universities-factsheet-ec2u.pdf)
  / [RI4C2](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101035803) funding MUST be licensed under
  the [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)
  license
* other well-established licenses enabling [open access](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) MAY be considered on a
  case-by-case basis and only after evaluating Creative Commons options; open source software licenses SHOULD be avoided
  in favor of specialized licenses covering creative content and datasets
