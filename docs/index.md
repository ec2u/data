The EC2U Knowledge Hub is the central knowledge sharing and semantic search facility of
the [EC2U Alliance](https://www.ec2u.eu/): it gathers, cleanses and cross-links content from a wide range of internal and
external data sources, providing user-facing apps, intelligence tools and other data consumers with a ready-to-use source
of structured data about skills, courses, research, local events and many other areas of common interest.
