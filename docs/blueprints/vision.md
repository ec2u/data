# Context

Alliance partners and other local stakeholders own large amounts of data about courses, skills, research activities and
local communities that could effectively support many internal and external consortium-wide use cases like cooperative
research, mobility planning and public engagement.

# Challenges

Available data is highly fragmented among a host of databases and web sites exposing a variety of access protocols and
data formats. Case-specific data gathering and integration solutions would quickly stack into a fragile and unscalable
network, far beyond current staffing capabilities and draining limited staff and budget away from user-facing
functionalities.

# Solution

Data gathering and integration are decoupled from app development and other data consuming activities by introducing a
central knowledge graph facility, implemented on top of WC3 Semantic web standards and open source components, acting as
a cooperative clearing house for local decentralised data assets:

- data providers are integrated only once, mapping local data models to high-level ontologies and sharing costs among a
  large consumer base
- data consumers easily tap into a consortium-wide source of clean cross-linked data, avoiding data integration and API
  development costs
- new internal and external data sources are incrementally introduced leveraging agile and low impact technologies like
  HTML Microdata

# Results

The graph-based approach reduces data integration and app development costs, enabling the alliance to implement a
scalable and sustainable knowledge sharing strategy, based on open standards, natively supporting multilingual content
and providing advanced semantic search capabilities.

Consolidated and easily accessible data makes it possible to handle in an efficient way many internal and external
processes requiring cross data views, to effectively support multi-channel publishing and to enable the creation of
third-party value-added services.
