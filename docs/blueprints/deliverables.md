## M12 D4.1 Databases directory

*Platform for data exchange via a directory of the available databases.*

*This task will provide a platform for data exchange through the EC2U Connect Centre/Knowledge Hub, via a directory of
the available databases. The directory will also define the dissemination level of the different data sets towards
partners and stakeholders.*

## M12 D4.2 Data dissemination definition

*Dissemination level of the different data sets will be defined with Alliance members*

*This task will provide a platform for data exchange through the EC2U Connect Centre/Knowledge Hub, via a directory of
the available databases. The directory will also define the dissemination level of the different data sets towards
partners and stakeholders.*

## M12 D4.3 R&I capacities database

*Searchable database on the existing R&I activities and facilities among the EC2U Alliance*

*WP4 will provide a searchable database on the existing R&I activities and facilities among the EC2U Alliance by using
research and semantic searches on the data provided by the seven universities, possibly through micro-data annotations on
their public web sites. This database will support the activities of WP2 (Task 2.1, Definition of a common EC2U R&I
agenda, Univ Salamanca), and in particular of the Virtual Institutes. It will also support Task 1.2 (Shared
transformation – on the legal status of the Alliances – Univ Poitiers).*

## M12 D4.5 Knowledge ecosystems database

*Database and supporting tools to map the local Knowledge ecosystems by identifying and classifying the local
stakeholders and relevant online resources*

*WP4 will develop a database and the supporting tools enabling partners to map the local knowledge ecosystems by
identifying and classifying the local stakeholders. This activity will be in support to WP6, Task 6.1 (Developing a
framework for local Knowledge ecosystems, Univ. Iasi)*
