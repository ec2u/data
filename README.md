# EC2U Knowledge Hub

The EC2U Knowledge Hub is the central knowledge sharing and semantic search facility of the
[EC2U Alliance](https://www.ec2u.eu/): it gathers, cleanses and cross-links content from a wide range of internal and
external data sources, providing data consumers like user-facing apps and intelligence tools a ready-to-use source of
structured data about skills, courses, research, local events and other areas of common interest.


# Datasets

EC2U Knowledge Hub resources are organized as a collection of cross-linked [datasets](datasets/index.md) published both
through an interactive [semantic search tool](blueprints/app.md) and a machine-readable
[REST/JSON-LD API](blueprints/api.md). Both services support extensive faceted search and linked data navigation
facilities.
