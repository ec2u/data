        """[The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda), adopted by all
        United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and
        the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which
        are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.
        They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that
        improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate
        change and working to preserve our oceans and forests."""@en ;
