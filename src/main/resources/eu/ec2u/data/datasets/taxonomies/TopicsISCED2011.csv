0,"Early childhood education",,"Encompasses programmes with a holistic approach to support young children's early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and introduce them to organised instruction outside the family context. It includes early childhood educational development (0-2 years) and pre-primary education (3 years to start of ISCED 1). These programmes are not necessarily highly structured but provide organised and purposeful learning activities in a safe environment, often through play-based activities."
1,"Primary education",,"Typically designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing, and mathematics (literacy and numeracy) and establish a solid foundation for learning in core knowledge areas, personal and social development, in preparation for lower secondary education. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity, often organised around units, projects, or broad learning areas with an integrated approach. Typically, one main teacher is responsible for a group of pupils."
2,"Lower secondary education",,"Typically designed to build on the learning outcomes from ISCED 2011 Level 1, aiming to lay the foundation for lifelong learning. The curriculum is usually more subject-oriented, introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects. Teachers typically have pedagogical training in specific subjects, and students may have several teachers with specialised knowledge."
3,"Upper secondary education",,"Typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Instruction is more varied, specialised, and in-depth than at ISCED 2011 Level 2, with a greater range of options and streams available. Teachers are often highly qualified in their subjects."
4,"Post-secondary non-tertiary education",,"Provides learning experiences building on secondary education, preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It aims for the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies lower than tertiary education. The content is not sufficiently complex to be tertiary but is clearly post-secondary, often more specialised or detailed than upper secondary. Entry requires completion of ISCED 2011 Level 3."
5,"Short-cycle tertiary education",,"Often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills, and competencies. Typically practically-based and occupationally-specific, preparing students for the labour market, but may also offer a pathway to other tertiary programmes. Entry requires successful completion of ISCED Level 3 or 4 with access to tertiary education. These programmes have more complex content than ISCED 2011 Levels 3 and 4 but are shorter and usually less theoretically-oriented than ISCED 2011 Level 6, with a minimum duration of two years."
6,"Bachelor's or equivalent level",Bachelor,"Often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills, and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by research or best professional practice. Entry normally requires successful completion of an ISCED 2011 Level 3 or 4 programme with access to tertiary education. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years."
7,"Master's or equivalent level",Master,"Often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills, and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. May have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to a doctoral qualification. Typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by research or best professional practice. Entry into second or further degree programmes normally requires successful completion of an ISCED 2011 Level 6 or 7 programme. ISCED 2011 Level 7 programmes have significantly more complex content than Level 6 and are usually more specialised."
8,"Doctoral or equivalent level",Doctorate,"Represents the highest level of tertiary education, typically involving advanced research and leading to a doctoral qualification. Entry usually requires successful completion of ISCED 2011 Level 7. These programmes are dedicated to advanced study and original research, typically requiring the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality."
9,"Not elsewhere classified",,"Education programmes that cannot be classified within the ISCED 2011 Levels 0-8. This category is not a part of the ISCED classification itself but is provided in data collections to capture education programmes that cannot be categorized in one of the defined education levels."
