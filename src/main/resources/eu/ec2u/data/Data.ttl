- The focal research area Life includes excellent basic and applied research in microbiology and biodiversity, with a strong emphasis on microbial communication processes and ecosystem research. Life also examines infection, inﬂammation, and ageing.
- The focal research area Liberty combines humanities research on the Enlightenment and idealism, on romanticism, contemporary history, and social change.

The University also has a long history of excellence in learning and teaching. It has consistently been rated one of Germany’s best universities for the education and the support it provides to students from all backgrounds.
