# How We Use AI

This website uses AI-generated content (text, labels, and descriptions created by AI) and crawler-based content
(information automatically gathered from other sources). Here's how we use these tools:

- **Gathering information**: Automated tools collect data from partner institutions and other sources
- **Enriching content**: AI adds descriptions, labels, and summaries
- **Organizing**: AI sorts and tags items to make them easier to find
- **Multiple languages**: AI helps process content in different languages

# Using AI Content Responsibly

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Don't rely only on AI-generated content for important decisions** - it may have errors, be incomplete, out of
> date, or even made up. Always verify important information with official sources.

**Your responsibilities**: By using this website, you agree to verify important information with official sources, use
AI content as a starting point (not the final word), check original sources when provided, and report any problems you
find.

**Our liability**: We are not responsible for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in automated content. You accept the
risks of relying on this information and are responsible for verifying it before making decisions.

**Content changes**: We may update or remove automated content at any time without notice.

# Feedback and Questions

We're always working to improve our automated systems through regular updates, quality checks, and sanity checks to
catch obvious mistakes. Your feedback helps us know what needs fixing and makes the site better for everyone.
