External supporting datasets may also be listed in the catalog for reference and ease of access.

# Data Model

![dataset data model](../datasets/index/datasets.svg)

EC2U datasets are described using a controlled subset of [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) and  [VoID](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/) data models.

## ec2u:Dataset

| property                                                     | description                                                  |

| [dct:license](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_license) | the URL of the public text of the [licensing](../policies/licensing.md) terms for the catalog as a whole; entries in the dataset define their own licensing terms |
| [dct:rights](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_rights) | the copyright statement (e.g. `Copyright Â© 2022 EC2U Alliance`) |
| [dct:accessRights](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_access_rights) | a human-readable, localized description of access rights and policies for partners and other stakeholders |
| [void:uriSpace](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#pattern)         | the common prefix of the IRIs of the principal entities in the dataset; if not specified, defaults to the IRI of the dataset (e.g. `https://data.ec2u.eu/events/`) |
| [void:entities](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#statistics)      | the count of the principal entities in the dataset, that is of the datatset entities whos IRI starts with the prefix defined by the `void:uriSpace` property |
